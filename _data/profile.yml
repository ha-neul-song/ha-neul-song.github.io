  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Sciences, with training in AI and Emerging Technologies in Medicine. I am affiliated with the Center for Advanced Circuit Therapeutics, directed by <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4TpBCq8AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Helen S. Mayberg</a></em>, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. 
  </p>
  <p>  
    My research focuses on <span style="color:#AD1C42;"><strong>personalized brain stimulation approaches</strong></span> for psychiatric and neurological disorders, with the goal of improving precision and clinical outcomes. I work with both invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    My work emphasizes <span style="color:#AD1C42;"><strong>connectivity-informed brain stimulation strategies</strong></span>, applied to conditions such as depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, essential tremor, and epilepsy. This work additionally leverages large-scale public datasets and cognitive task–based paradigms to inform and evaluate stimulation effects.
